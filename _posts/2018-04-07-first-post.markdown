>**Talk is cheap. Show me the code.**

This is an "Initial Commit" to my first personal website.

It is not necessary for me to have a personal site, I know. But I really enjoy coding in all sorts of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So, I asked myself, why not building up a site, and taking it as a way to get familiarized with a new skill.

So here comes this site.

But there is actually another purpose.
From the very beginning of learning programming, I have always been eager to learn everything I grab, especially those pertinent to some kind of problems confronted. However, the solutions to some problems are not currently available on the Internet. So I think, why not sharing my thoughts first. Contributions to the open source community are my responsibilities as a Pythonist.

So here comes this site.

Currently, my major mission is to find a job in AI, ideally deep learning, computer vision or natural language processing. But still, I would try my best to share my thoughts here with the worldwide coding community.
