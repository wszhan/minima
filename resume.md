### Brief Introduction

What I am able to do:
- Read machine learning/deep learning papers and **implement the state-of-the-art algorithms** in Python
- **Troubleshoot problems proactively** by integrating all possible resources
- **Teamwork with people of various backgrounds** both online and offline
- Communicate professionally in **English, Chinese Mandarin, and Cantonese**

### Skills
Familiar with:
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow
- Object-oriented programming (in Python)

Have experience using:
- Scikit-Learn, OpenCV3, MySQL, C
- Unix, Ubuntu, Linux

### Education

#### **Udacity**

**Deep Learning Nanodegree, Udacity, 2018.01 - 2018.06**
> The focus of this Nanodegree is to implementation state-of-the-art algorithms by reading classic and up-to-date papers. The implementations are mostly in Python, Keras and Tensorflow, with the aid of other open-source libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, PIL, OpenCV3, etc.
